;; Add graphical view of agenda to agenda buffer.

;; This package adds a graphical view of the agenda after the last
;; agenda line.  By default the display starts at 5 AM today and
;; goes up to 4 AM next day (this covers 24 hours).

;; Scheduled tasks or tasks with time ranges are rendered in the
;; display with `org-timeline-block' face.  Clocked entires are
;; displayed in `org-timeline-clocked' face.  The background of
;; timeslots which are in the past is highlighted with
;; `org-timeline-elapsed' face.

;; You can use custom color for a task by adding the property
;; `TIMELINE_FACE' with either a string which is a color name or a
;; list which specifies the face properties or a symbol which is
;; taken to be a face name.
